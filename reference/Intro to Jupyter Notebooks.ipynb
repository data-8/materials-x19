    "A Jupyter Notebook is a file/notebook that can contain both code and regular text (like this paragraph here!) as well as math formulas, images, links, and more. The fact that a Jupyter Notebook can contains all of these various elements makes it a valuable tool for people, especially when doing data analysis, since the analysis description and the results can be contained in the same document. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to run and execute a Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "1. On a local Desktop (which requires no internet access)\n",
    "2. On a remote server (many Berkeley classes like Data 8X and Data 100 use this option so you can save your work and submit it online)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every notebook has something called a ** kernel **, which acts as the operation part of the notebook. With the kernel, we can execute the lines of code that are in a notebook. When you open a notebook, the kernel associated with that notebook is automatically launched as well. When we execute or run a notebook (more on this down below), the kernel performs the computations and then returns the results. To see when the kernel is running/executing, you can look at the top right hand corner of your notebook, at a circle. If the circle is gray/filled in, the kernel is currently executing cells. If the circle is not filled in, the kernel is not currently executing cells. In the diagram below, the circle shows us that the kernel is not executing anything at the moment. \n",

Any Python code that is written will be in a \"Code\" cell, while paragraphs and images will be in a \"Markdown\" cell. \n",
