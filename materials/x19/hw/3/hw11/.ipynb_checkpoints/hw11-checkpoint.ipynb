If you submit more than once before the deadline, we will only grade your final submission. If you mistakenly submit the wrong one, you can head to [okpy.org](https://okpy.org/) and flag the correct version. To do so, go to the website, click on this assignment, and find the version you would like to have graded. There should be an option to flag that submission for grading!"
